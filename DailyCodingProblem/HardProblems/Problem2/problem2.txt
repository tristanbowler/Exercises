Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers of the original array except the one at i. 
For example, if out input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].
If out input was [3,2,1], the expected output would be [2,3,6].
